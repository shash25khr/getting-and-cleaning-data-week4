### Project Aim: 
The goal of the project is to create one R script called run_analysis.R which has the following functionalities.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Files 'CodeBook.md' contains information on the variables, data set, transformations and work that was done to tidy up the data

'run_analysis.R' is the code for the R script used to complete the project goals

'FinalTidyData.txt' is the output from the 'runAnalysis.R' R script
